# DXC Industrialized AI Starter

This __DXC Industrialized AI Starter__ is a python library which is extensively developed and can be used for all AI projects. This library is an open source , using this library  makes it easier to build and deploy a machine-learning microservice. 
It installs all the required library dependencies, builds a model, deploys a microservice, and publishes an API endpoint to the microservice.

  
## Requirements/Pre-requisites:

Requires <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python 3.7</a> and above to be installed in the system in order to use the above library.
