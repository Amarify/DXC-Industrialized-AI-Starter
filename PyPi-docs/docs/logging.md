# Logging Functionality

Logging is an important module in tracking the work or performance. Maintaining logs helps is tracing the error, variable value and other many uses.

DXC industrialized AI starter also performs default logging for few crucial functions. We have provided the automatic logging functionality for below major funtions in this library.

- Build Data Pipelines
- Run AI Experiments
- Publish Microservice

These auto logging is introduced to save the user build pipelines, inputs provided for run experiment function and also to store the microservice design skeleton used for publishing model in algorithmia.

These logs can be referred back in case to rerun or reuse any pipeline or microservice design details.
Logs will be saved in the same location where notebook with functions used. Refer to sample example notebook for reference of sample logs.
